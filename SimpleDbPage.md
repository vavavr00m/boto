**Support for SimpleDB in boto**

I participated in the private beta for SimpleDB and wrote an a boto module to support it long ago.  Now that it's public, I can actually check the code in.  Yeah!

The code that is currently checked in works with the version of the API that is currently running as part of the private beta.  When the Public Beta officially starts (in the next few weeks according to AWS) a new version of the API will be rolled out.  The changes are pretty minor.  I have made the changes locally but until AWS makes the new API available I am unable to test that code.

So, as soon as the Public Beta begins and the new API is available, I will check in the new version of the boto module and we can all bask in the coolness of SimpleDB.  Until then, feel free to check out the current code in subversion to get a feel for how it works and feel free to send comments and suggestions.

See SimpleDbIntro for a quick introduction to the SimpleDB interface in boto.
