The issue tracking for the boto project is now managed on [GitHub](http://github.com/) rather than on Google Code.  To access the boto issue tracker, visit:

http://github.com/boto/boto.

Issues from Google Code are being reviewed and moved over to Github.

You can also still browse the original boto subversion repo here:
