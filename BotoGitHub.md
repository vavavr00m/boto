The source code for the boto project is now managed on [GitHub](http://github.com/) rather than on Google Code.  To access the source code, visit:

http://github.com/boto/boto.

You can still access the GitHub repository using Subversion tools.  See:

http://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support

You can also still browse the original boto subversion repo here:
