#So what the heck is a boto?

According to [http://wikipedia.org/ wikipedia] a boto is:

{{{
The Boto, Amazon River Dolphin or Pink River Dolphin[1] (Inia geoffrensis) is a freshwater river dolphin endemic to the Amazon River and Orinoco River systems.
}}}

Okay, so it's a pretty lame name but why don't you go try to find a short name that has some relevance to Amazon that isn't already taken 8^)
