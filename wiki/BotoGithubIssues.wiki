#summary Boto Issues on github.com

The issue tracking for the boto project is now managed on [http://github.com/ GitHub] rather than on Google Code.  To access the boto issue tracker, visit:

http://github.com/boto/boto.  

Issues from Google Code are being reviewed and moved over to Github.

You can also still browse the original boto subversion repo here:
